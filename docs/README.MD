<h2>My Purpose - 
<h4>To pass my Assessment, to gain skills and learn how to better express myself with website design.
<h2>Functionality / features
<h4>Functionality is somewhat limited being the first website I have ever tried to code on my own. I am however pleased with my results and know I can only get much better over time.
My features include links to my resume, github as well as a contact page with links directly to my email and messenger account.
